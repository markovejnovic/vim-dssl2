# vim-dssl2

vim-dssl2 is a vim plugin for the [dssl2](https://github.com/tov/dssl2)
[racket](https://racket-lang.org/) sublanguage.

This plugin arose from the need to write a usable plugin for the language.

I love vim (you probably will too) and dssl2 doesn't have a plugin. That's how
we got here.
